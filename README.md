## Installation of Unity
	
	To be able to create a game project in Unity, you first need to download the Unity itself. 
	The web site for Unity is pretty understandable and useful for the future tutorials. 
	Here is the download link for unity

	-https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download

	There you can either choose Unity Hub or Unity+. The Unity Hub is a standalone application 
	that streamlines the way you find, download, and manage your Unity Projects and installations.

	After you successfully downloaded the Unity, you need to have an IDE to write your scripts. The
	JetBrains Rider is recommended for Unity users, because of the compatibility between the two. 

## Installation of JetBrains Rider

	JetBrains Rider is a cross-platform . NET IDE based on the IntelliJ platform and ReSharper.
	You can download JetBrains Rider in here

	-https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/#section=windows

	(C# is the recommended language for Unity projects but you can use other languages too.)

	 You can read this blog to learn more about why you should use C#

## Connecting JetBrains to your Unity project

	You need to connect your IDE to your game project, in order to write a game script that
	will affect your project in the way you want to. 
	Here you can find a guide for that

	After you installed all the tools that I mentioned above and done the necessary steps like connection
	You can now skip to how you will use this code. 

	1) Download our project files. Choose a location.
	   
	2) Open your Unity Hub and press "Add" button. Choose your project location.

	3) After you have succesfully open our project, you might want to chosee the scene to begin with.
	   For this, go to Project Window > Assets > Scenes.

	5) The recommended start scene is: Assets > Scenes > Menu.unity to be able to see our Menu. 

	6) If you press the play button above the game scene, you will be able to play the game. 

	7) If you go to another scene, and press the play button (play button on Unity's interface), you will be able to start at that scene. 

	8) If you want to do some additional coding work, you can open one of our scripts in the JetBrains 
	   Rider that I mentioned above and start coding.
